This repository demonstrates a common error in Elixir when attempting to modify a list while iterating over it using `Enum.each`. The provided code attempts to remove the element 3 from the list, but due to the immutable nature of Elixir lists, the modification is not reflected in the original list during the iteration process. The solution showcases alternative approaches using `Enum.filter` or `Enum.reduce` to achieve the desired outcome.
